                <h3 align="center">Welcome to the Strategic Decision-Making Experiment. </h3>
                <br>
                <b>Overview:</b> Instructions (this page), Game 1, Game 2, Post-Experiment Questionnaire
                <br><br>
                <b>Player types:</b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>You</li>
                    <li>Other human players</li>
                    <li>Human players who have artificial intelligence advisors</li>
                    <li>Artificial intelligence players and advisors</li>
                    <li>Human expert advisors</li>
                </ul>
                In at least one game, you will have access to a human expert advisor and an artificial intelligence advisor.
                <br><br>
                Your <b>human competitors</b> are participants like you.
                <br><br>
                The <b>artificially intelligent competitors and advisors </b>are sophisticated learning algorithms trained by playing against human players and other AI algorithms using a learning technique called recursive self-play. They use various frameworks including deep learning, neural networks, and counterfactual regret minimization.
                <br><br>
                The <b>human expert advisors </b>have been trained in optimal strategies for the kinds of games you will be playing.

                <b>Performance:</b> Your goal is to compete and make decisions such as to maximize your score. There is a side bet going between SOS, ACSC, AWC, and SAASS on which students do the best.
                <br><br>
                Good luck!
