<p> 
    Thank you for your participation in this experiment. 
</p>
<br>
<p>As stated in the introduction, here’s a debrief on your competitors and advisors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All players who were not you played non-conditional strategies in order to control for variation which might have affected your decision-making in ways the experiment could not account for.</li>
    <li>The human player was a real person.</li>
    <li>The AI’s (both advisors and competitors) were algorithms which used non-conditional strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, in real life, there ARE real artificial intelligence algorithms which can play such games very well and can advise decision-makers. In fact, they exhibit some very interesting and advanced, but very non-human, characteristics. If you are interested in learning more, the researcher will happily discuss the topic with you. 
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Please do not share your experience in the game with anyone </b>until told by the researcher that is ok to discuss. You can understand how a participant's prior knowledge of the information on this page would corrupt the experiment.  </p>
