                Thank you for your participation in this experiment. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As stated in the introduction, hereâ€™s a debrief on your competitors and advisors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In all games, all advisors and players were simulated.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>In the Peace-War Game: All competitors and advisors used non-conditional strategies in order to control for variation which might have affected your decision-making in ways the experiment could not account for.</li>
            </ul>
     
            <ul>
                <li>In the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: All competitors and advisors used a conditional algorithm in order to control for variation in your score which might have affected your decision-making in ways the experiment could not account for.</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Today, in real life, there ARE real artificial intelligence algorithms which can play such games very well and can advise decision-makers. In fact, they exhibit some very interesting and advanced, but very non-human, characteristics. <b>If you are interested in learning more or playing against one of these artificial intelligence players today, please let the proctor know.</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Please do not share your experiences today with anyone </b>until told by the researcher that is ok to discuss. You can understand how a participant's prior knowledge of the information on this page would corrupt the experiment.  </p>
