<p> 
    Thank you for your participation in this experiment. 
</p>
<br>
<p>As stated in the introduction, hereâ€™s a debrief on your competitors and advisors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All other competitors and advisors used non-conditional strategies in order to control for variation which might have affected your decision-making in ways the experiment could not account for.</li>
    <li>The human players and advisors were simulated by an algorithm which used non-conditional strategies.</li>
    <li>The AI advisors and competitors were also algorithms which used non-conditional strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, in real life, there ARE real artificial intelligence algorithms which can play such games very well and can advise decision-makers. In fact, they exhibit some very interesting and advanced, but very non-human, characteristics. If you are interested in learning more or playing against one of these artificial intelligence players, please let the proctor know.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Please do not share your experiences today with anyone </b>until told by the researcher that is ok to discuss. You can understand how a participant's prior knowledge of the information on this page would corrupt the experiment.  </p>
