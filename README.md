# The Strategic Decision-making Experiment (Spear's Dissertation)

## quick start

Go to https://still-falls-66166.herokuapp.com/

To see the experiment in action, select "Experiment Start to Finish." then follow select the bottom link to open the experiment.  

Notes:
- Version: 0.1
- This is still a dev version - participant will see something different.
- This link is a series of apps.

To do:
- Add counterbalancing (will do this by repeating apps then hiding unused ones.  Probably a better way to do this, but will only explore if I have time.  Either way, results will be the same).<br>
-- (PW,RPS-H,RPS-A), (RPS-H,RPS-A,PW), (RPS-A,RPS-H,PW), (PW,RPS-A,RPS-H)
- Change/update/add immediate feedback on decisions
- change/update/add post-game feedback

Fixed:
- Removed flying F-16 (or fix animation)
- removed "what type of algorithm were you playing against?"
- Added other participant IDs & wait pages.
- fixed html formatting errors
- started version tracking


Otherwise, click on any app.
For 1-Participant games, select the bottom link to open the game in a new tab.

For 2-participant games, select the link just below "open in split screen."
